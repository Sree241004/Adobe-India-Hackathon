Or, they intentionally design a form that you can fill in only by hand or with the Fill & Sign tool. These non-interactive forms are called flat forms. Fill in interactive forms An interactive form contains fields that you can select or fill in. 1. If necessary, select either the Hand Tool or the Select Tool from the context menu of the page (right-click on the page to open the context menu). The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, the Hand tool changes to an I-beam when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages.",

It could be a paper form or PDF that hasn’t been optimized for form filling. The Fill & Sign tool automatically detects the form fields like text fields, comb fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. You can manually add text and other symbols anywhere on the form using the Fill & Sign tool if required. You can complete the forms by entering information and adding your signatures. Acrobat also allows you to send your completed forms to others and securely save them in Adobe cloud storage. Fill and sign PDF forms To complete and sign PDF forms, open the form in Acrobat and then select E-Sign from the global bar. Alternatively, you can select All tools > Fill & Sign. It displays the Fill & Sign tools in the left pane. You can now fill in the form fields and sign the form using the sign tools described in the following topics. To fill text fields: 1. From the left panel, select Fill in form fields , and then select the field where you want to add text. It displays a text field along with a toolbar. 2. Select the text field again and enter your text. 3. To reposition the text box to align it with the text field, select the textbox and hover over it. Once you see a plus icon with arrows, move the textbox to the desired position. 4. To edit the text, select the text box. Once you see the cursor and keypad, edit the text and then click elsewhere to enter. 5. To change the text size, select A or A as required.",
